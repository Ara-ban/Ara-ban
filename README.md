### **Writing this as of September 3rd 2024:**

I'm focusing on sharpening **3 types of skills** as I go through my final year of studies:

- 🧠 **ML and Data Science**  
- ⚙️ **Programming efficiently with C++**  
  (Deepening my understanding of low-level programming and system operations)
- 📊 **Mathematics related to Quantitative Finance**

### 🎯 **Targeted Roles:**
- Quantitative Researcher (QR)
- Quantitative Developer (QD)
- Data Scientist (DS)

The choice of role will depend on opportunities and how things unveil in the next months. 🚀

## **Saitama Routine 🥋** (Daily Learning Goals)

### **Each day, I commit to:**
- 🏆 **At least 1 competition submission** on Kaggle, Zindi, or ENS data challenges  
  *(Objective: No more than 2 weeks in one competition)*

- 💻 **Solve 5 leetcode-like problems**  
  *(Focusing on specific data structures and learning standard algorithms along the way)*

- 📚 **2 hours of core mathematics**  
  *(Covering probability theory, statistics, stochastic calculus, linear algebra, optimization, and numerical methods)*

- 🖥️ **1 hour of studying OS/Networks**  
  *(Leading up to knowledge of assembly language and how machines work, linking it to programming languages)*

- 🧩 **Solve 5 brainteasers**  
  *(To sharpen problem-solving and creative thinking)*

---

### **Additional Weekend Focus**:
- 📖 **Reading research papers**  
  *(Grasping the statistics and architectures behind state-of-the-art ML models or exploring new research in Quantitative Finance)*
